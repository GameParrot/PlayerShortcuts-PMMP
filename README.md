# PlayerShortcuts-PMMP
This plugin adds all the vanilla player shortcuts except for `@e` to Pocketmine. For example you can use `@s` in /give instead of having to type your username manually.

# Permissions
Players with the permission `playershortcuts.use` can use the shortcuts. This is set to operators only by default to avoid abuse (ex: using @a to run a command on every player and lag the server).
